    <string name="ohm_law_description"><b>Ohm\'s law</b> states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:\n
        \n<b>I = V/R</b>,
        \n\nwhere <b><i>I</i></b> is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, <b><i>V</i></b> is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts, and <b><i>R</i></b> is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm\'s law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current.
        \nThe law was named after the German physicist Georg Ohm, who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. He presented a slightly more complex equation than the one above to explain his experimental results. The above equation is the modern form of Ohm\'s law.
